Both effect the votes obtained slightly (about a few hundred votes total going either way). One recount at Châteauguay—Lacolle flipped the election result, causing the Liberal to beat the Bloc Quebecois candidate, the first time such a thing has happened since 2008. This is why the Liberals have 160 MPs and the BQ 32 MPs in Canada's parliament. For the purposes of consistency, I will stick with the validated results for all ridings instead of including the judicially recount results for the two ridings that requested them."
